# Resume Placeholder

To add your resume:

1. Create or export your resume as a PDF file
2. Rename it to `resume.pdf`
3. Place it in this `public` folder
4. The download button on your portfolio will automatically link to it

The path should be: `frontend/public/resume.pdf`

You can also add your profile photo here:
- `frontend/public/profile.jpg` (or .png)
- Then update the image source in `About.jsx`
